*Is your page layout off, but you canÂ´t find the reason?*

Colorize parts of, or your entire page layout in one go with react-show-my-divs.

-No more adding `background-color: 'red'` style to components to see how they fit in your layout.

*You can also*

* Supply the HTML element types you wish to colorize as a string array in the HTMLTypeNames prop.

* Supply your own color array woth the color prop.

* Render a 1px. border around every element with the borders prop.

*_Note: This component injects backgroundColor and borderColor CSS prop into your elements of choice.
That means that it will only colorize on elements that natively have these CSS props._*
